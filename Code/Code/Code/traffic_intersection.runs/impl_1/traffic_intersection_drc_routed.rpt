2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net Count_OneSecDelay_MSD_reg[0]/G0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin Count_OneSecDelay_MSD_reg[0]/L3_2/O, cell Count_OneSecDelay_MSD_reg[0]/L3_2 (in Count_OneSecDelay_MSD_reg[0] macro). This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net out_7seg_reg[6]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin out_7seg_reg[6]_i_2/O, cell out_7seg_reg[6]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net red_led_reg0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin red_led_reg[1]_i_1/O, cell red_led_reg[1]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net red_led_reg00_out is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin red_led_reg[0]_i_1/O, cell red_led_reg[0]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

ZPS7-1#1 Warning
PS7 block required  
The PS7 cell must be used in this Zynq design in order to enable correct default configuration.
Related violations: <none>
